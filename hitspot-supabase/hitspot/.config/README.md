# Environment Management Script

This script helps you manage environment configuration files for your projects. It allows you to create, choose, check, and remove environment files easily.

## Features

- **Create** a new environment file.
- **Choose** an existing environment file to activate.
- **Check** which environment file is currently active.
- **Remove** environment files.

## Installation

### Step 1: Make the Script Executable

Make the script executable by running the following command in the directory where your script is located:

```bash
chmod +x setup_env.py
```

## Usage

### Create a New Environment File

To create a new environment file:

```bash
setup_env create
```

This command will prompt you to enter the name of the environment file and the necessary environment variables (Supabase URL, Supabase Anon Key, Supabase Service Role, Google Maps API Key). It will then create a new `.env.<file_name>` file with the provided information.

### Choose an Existing Environment File

To choose an existing environment file:

```bash
setup_env choose
```

This command will list all existing environment files and prompt you to select one to set as the active environment. The chosen file will be copied to `.env`, making it the active environment file.

### Check Which Environment File is Active

To check which environment file is currently active:

```bash
setup_env check
```

This command will display the name of the currently active environment file. If no environment file is found or if the `.env` file was not generated by this script, appropriate messages will be shown.

### Remove Environment Files

To remove environment files:

```bash
setup_env remove
```

This command will list all existing environment files and prompt you to select one to delete. You also have the option to delete all environment files at once.

## Code Structure

### Functions

- **create_env_file():** Prompts the user to input the name of the environment file and various environment variables, then creates a new environment file.
- **choose_env_file():** Lists all existing environment files and allows the user to select one to set as the active environment.
- **check_environment():** Checks which environment file is currently active and displays its name.
- **remove_environment():** Lists all existing environment files and allows the user to delete one or all of them.

### Main Program

The main program uses `argparse` to handle command-line arguments and calls the corresponding function based on the specified action (`create`, `choose`, `check`, `remove`).
